Golang ius a **compiled language**.
( Compiled - Whole code is read first, then it creates an **exe** & then it runs. It is a **fast process**. )

Golang is incase-sensitive.
We can build **System apps to Web apps** using Golang.

## Lexer in Golang

All Programming languages including **Go** has a **lexer**. Lexer job is to check if you're following the grammer of the language like the **syntax** is correct.

Before compilation of the program, the lexer does it work of checking the syntax. Here in Go, lexer puts the **semicolon** at the **end of the line**, so we don't need to worry about putting the semicolons.
