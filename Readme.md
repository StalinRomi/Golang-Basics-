Golang is a programming language developed at **Google** in 2007 & **open sourced in 2009**.

Its a **compiled language**. It compiles into single binary (machine code) -> You can run it on different **Operating System**.  
( Compiled - Whole code is read first, then it creates an **exe** & then it runs. It is a **fast process**. )

Golang is incase-sensitive.
We can build **System apps to Web apps** using Golang.

## Why go was developed?

**Infrastructure evolved** a lot recently & - It became Scalable & distributed, Dynamic & had more capacity. But no programming languages were able to take full advantage of it.

Go was designed to run on **multiple cores & built to support concurrency**. It can be used for developing **distributed systems**.

## Characterstics of Go

1. Go is used on server side / backend of applications, so we can develop **Microservices, Web applications, Database Services using golang**.

2. Its easy to maintain it over time, because its easy to learn, read & write code.

3. It has a **fast Build time**, start up & run.

4. It requires **fewer resources** to run.

## Lexer in Golang

All Programming languages including **Go** has a **lexer**. Lexer job is to check if you're following the grammer of the language like the **syntax** is correct.

Before compilation of the program, the lexer does it work of checking the syntax. Here in Go, lexer puts the **semicolon** at the **end of the line**, so we don't need to worry about putting the semicolons.
